# Discovery Services

This directory contains all services related to the Sample Discovery feature.

## Structure

The discovery services are completely isolated from existing application services to ensure:
- No interference with ChopperPage functionality
- Independent error handling and recovery
- Separate API management and caching
- Isolated performance monitoring

## Services (To be implemented in subsequent tasks)

- `DiscoveryService` - Main service orchestrating sample discovery
- `MockSampleProvider` - Fallback data provider with vintage samples
- `YouTubeIntegration` - YouTube API integration for real sample data
- `FilterEngine` - Client and server-side filtering logic
- `ErrorRecoveryService` - Retry logic and graceful degradation
- `PerformanceMonitor` - Discovery-specific performance tracking

## Isolation Principles

1. **No Shared Services**: Services in this directory are independent from existing services
2. **Separate Error Handling**: Discovery errors are contained and handled independently
3. **Independent Caching**: Uses separate cache management from other features
4. **Isolated API Management**: Separate API keys, rate limiting, and quota management

## Requirements Addressed

- **1.1**: Isolated service layer for discovery functionality
- **1.2**: Zero dependencies on existing ChopperPage services
- **1.3**: Independent state and service management
