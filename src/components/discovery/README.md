# Discovery Components

This directory contains all React components related to the Sample Discovery feature.

## Structure

The discovery feature is completely isolated from the ChopperPage functionality to ensure:
- Zero performance impact on existing features
- No shared state or dependencies
- Independent error handling and recovery
- Separate routing and navigation

## Components (To be implemented in subsequent tasks)

- `SampleCard` - Individual sample display component
- `DiscoveryControls` - Filter and control interface
- `DiscoveryVideoPlayer` - Dedicated YouTube player for discovery
- `FavoritesPanel` - Favorites management component
- `HistoryPanel` - Discovery history tracking component

## Isolation Principles

1. **No ChopperPage Dependencies**: Components in this directory must not import anything from `../chopper/`
2. **Separate State Management**: All state is managed independently from ChopperPage
3. **Error Boundaries**: Discovery errors are contained and do not affect other features
4. **Independent Services**: Uses dedicated services from `../../services/discovery/`

## Requirements Addressed

- **1.1**: Dedicated discovery page with own YouTube player
- **1.2**: Zero imports or dependencies on ChopperPage components  
- **1.3**: Isolated state management preventing performance impact
