# Sequencer Grid Implementation

## Overview

This document describes the implementation of Task 5: "Build sequencer grid interface" for the drum sequencer feature. The implementation includes three main components and supporting hooks that provide a complete sequencer grid interface with real-time playhead synchronization.

## Components Implemented

### 1. SequencerGrid Component (`src/components/sequencer/SequencerGrid.jsx`)

The main grid component that orchestrates the sequencer interface.

**Features:**
- Dynamic grid rendering based on step resolution (8, 16, 32 steps)
- Visual playhead indicator with smooth animation
- Step number headers with beat emphasis
- Track name display with color coding
- Multi-select support with keyboard shortcuts
- Real-time timing accuracy display (development mode)
- Responsive layout with existing design patterns

**Props:**
- `pattern`: Current pattern data with tracks and steps
- `stepResolution`: Number of steps in the pattern (8, 16, 32)
- `sequencerEngine`: Reference to the SequencerEngine instance
- `onStepToggle`: Callback for step activation/deactivation
- `onStepVelocityChange`: Callback for velocity changes

**Key Features:**
- Integrates with `useSequencerPlayhead` hook for real-time synchronization
- Supports keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl/Cmd for multi-select, Space to toggle, Escape to clear)
- Shows interpolated playhead position for smooth animation
- Displays timing accuracy metrics in development mode

### 2. SequencerStep Component (`src/components/sequencer/SequencerStep.jsx`)

Individual step component with advanced interaction capabilities.

**Features:**
- Active/inactive visual states with track color integration
- Velocity indicator for active steps
- Right-click and double-click velocity editing
- Hover effects and selection indicators
- Current step highlighting with pulse animation
- Debounced velocity changes to prevent excessive updates

**Props:**
- `trackId`: Unique track identifier
- `stepIndex`: Step position (0-based)
- `step`: Step data (active state, velocity)
- `trackColor`: Visual color for the track
- `isActive`: Whether the step is active
- `isSelected`: Whether the step is selected
- `isCurrentStep`: Whether this is the current playback step
- `isHovered`: Whether the step is being hovered
- `velocity`: Step velocity (0.0-1.0)
- Various callback functions for interactions

**Interaction Modes:**
- Click: Toggle step on/off
- Shift+Click: Select/deselect step
- Right-click/Double-click: Open velocity editor (active steps only)
- Hover: Visual feedback and step key generation

### 3. Playhead Synchronization Hook (`src/hooks/useSequencerPlayhead.js`)

Custom React hook that provides real-time playhead synchronization with the SequencerEngine.

**Features:**
- Real-time step position updates from SequencerEngine
- Smooth interpolated playhead movement
- Timing accuracy monitoring
- Performance-optimized animation loop (60fps)
- Automatic cleanup of callbacks and animation frames

**Returns:**
- `currentStep`: Current discrete step position
- `interpolatedStep`: Smooth interpolated position for animations
- `isPlaying`: Current playback state
- `playheadPosition`: Position within the current pattern
- `playheadProgress`: Progress as percentage (0-1)
- `timingAccuracy`: Timing precision in milliseconds
- `getTimingInfo()`: Detailed timing information for debugging
- `syncPlayhead()`: Manual synchronization function

**Animation Hook (`usePlayheadAnimation`):**
- Manages visual effects for the playhead
- Provides pulsing animation synchronized with playback
- Returns styling functions for consistent visual feedback

## Integration Points

### SequencerPage Integration

The SequencerGrid is integrated into the SequencerPage with:
- SequencerEngine initialization and management
- PatternManager for pattern data management
- SampleManager for audio sample handling
- State synchronization between services and UI components

### Service Layer Integration

- **SequencerEngine**: Provides timing and playback control
- **PatternManager**: Handles pattern data and step manipulation
- **SampleManager**: Manages audio samples (future integration)
- **AudioScheduler**: Precise timing for playhead synchronization

## Visual Design

### Color Palette Integration
- Uses existing application color scheme
- Track colors: Red, orange, yellow, green, cyan, blue, purple spectrum
- Playhead: Cyan (#06b6d4) with glow effects
- Active steps: Track color with velocity-based opacity
- Selected steps: Cyan border and indicators

### Styling Patterns
- Consistent with existing TriggerPad component styling
- Dark mode backdrop blur effects
- Smooth transitions and hover effects
- Responsive grid layout
- Visual feedback for all interactions

## Performance Optimizations

### Animation Performance
- RequestAnimationFrame for smooth playhead movement
- Throttled updates to prevent excessive re-renders
- Efficient step rendering with React.memo patterns
- Debounced velocity changes

### Memory Management
- Proper cleanup of event listeners and timers
- Automatic callback removal on component unmount
- Efficient pattern data structures
- Minimal re-renders through optimized state management

## Testing

### Unit Tests
- **SequencerGrid.test.jsx**: Comprehensive component testing
- **SequencerStep.test.jsx**: Individual step interaction testing
- Mock implementations for external dependencies
- Keyboard shortcut and interaction testing

### Integration Testing
- Service integration with React components
- Real-time synchronization testing
- Performance and timing accuracy validation

## Keyboard Shortcuts

- **Click**: Toggle step on/off
- **Shift+Click**: Select/deselect step for multi-selection
- **Ctrl/Cmd+Click**: Multi-select mode
- **Space**: Toggle all selected steps
- **Escape**: Clear all selections
- **Right-click/Double-click**: Open velocity editor (active steps)

## Development Features

### Debug Information
- Timing accuracy display in development mode
- Performance metrics in console
- Step interaction logging
- Real-time state monitoring

### Demo Support
- Standalone demo component (`SequencerGrid.demo.js`)
- Example pattern with pre-configured steps
- Interactive testing environment

## Usage Example

```jsx
import SequencerGrid from './components/sequencer/SequencerGrid';
import { SequencerEngine } from './services/sequencer/SequencerEngine';

function MySequencer() {
  const [sequencerEngine, setSequencerEngine] = useState(null);
  const [currentPattern, setCurrentPattern] = useState(null);

  const handleStepToggle = (trackId, stepIndex) => {
    // Handle step toggle logic
  };

  const handleVelocityChange = (trackId, stepIndex, velocity) => {
    // Handle velocity change logic
  };

  return (
    <SequencerGrid
      pattern={currentPattern}
      stepResolution={16}
      sequencerEngine={sequencerEngine}
      onStepToggle={handleStepToggle}
      onStepVelocityChange={handleVelocityChange}
    />
  );
}
```

This implementation provides a solid foundation for the drum sequencer grid interface with professional-grade features and performance optimizations.
