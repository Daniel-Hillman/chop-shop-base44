# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for implementing a professional-grade drum track sequencer feature within the existing audio application. The sequencer will provide precise timing, low-latency playback, and comprehensive track controls while maintaining visual consistency with the current dark mode design. The feature will be developed on a dedicated branch with isolated testing before integration into the main application.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a music producer, I want a dedicated sequencer page accessible from the main UI, so that I can create and edit drum patterns independently of other app features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user navigates to `/sequencer` THEN the system SHALL display a dedicated sequencer interface
2. WHEN the user accesses the sequencer page THEN the system SHALL load independently without affecting other app components
3. WHEN the sequencer is running THEN the system SHALL allow simultaneous use of other app features like the chopper page
4. IF the user is on the sequencer page THEN the system SHALL maintain the existing dark mode design language

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a music producer, I want precise BPM control with stable timing, so that I can create professional-quality drum patterns without timing drift.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user adjusts the BPM control THEN the system SHALL maintain stable and precise timing
2. WHEN the sequencer is playing THEN the system SHALL provide sample-accurate clock scheduling using Web Audio API
3. WHEN the sequencer runs for extended periods THEN the system SHALL prevent timing drift
4. IF the sequencer is active THEN the system SHALL maintain low latency audio playback
5. WHEN the internal clock is running THEN the system SHALL remain rock-solid and performant

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a music producer, I want swing control and step resolution options, so that I can add groove and vary the rhythmic complexity of my patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user adjusts swing control THEN the system SHALL apply timing variations to create groove
2. WHEN the user selects step resolution (1/8, 1/16, 1/32) THEN the system SHALL dynamically update the grid layout
3. WHEN step resolution changes THEN the system SHALL preserve existing pattern data where possible
4. IF the user changes resolution THEN the system SHALL provide visual feedback of the grid update

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a music producer, I want each drum instrument to map to its own sample with preloaded audio files, so that I can trigger different drum sounds accurately.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the sequencer loads THEN the system SHALL preload all drum samples
2. WHEN a step is triggered THEN the system SHALL play the corresponding drum sample with minimal latency
3. WHEN samples are loaded THEN the system SHALL map each drum instrument to its specific audio file
4. IF samples fail to load THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate error handling and fallback

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a music producer, I want visual playhead indication synchronized with playback, so that I can see exactly where the sequencer is in the pattern.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the sequencer is playing THEN the system SHALL display a visual playhead indicator
2. WHEN the playhead moves THEN the system SHALL synchronize movement with audio playback timing
3. WHEN the pattern loops THEN the system SHALL reset the playhead to the beginning smoothly
4. IF the sequencer is paused THEN the system SHALL maintain playhead position

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a music producer, I want individual volume controls per track, so that I can balance the mix of different drum elements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user adjusts a track's volume control THEN the system SHALL modify only that track's output level
2. WHEN volume changes are made THEN the system SHALL apply changes in real-time during playback
3. WHEN the sequencer loads THEN the system SHALL initialize all tracks with default volume levels
4. IF a track is muted (volume at 0) THEN the system SHALL still display the track but produce no audio

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a music producer, I want optional randomization features for velocity and timing, so that I can add natural dynamics and human groove to my patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user enables velocity randomization THEN the system SHALL vary hit volume within the specified range (0-100%)
2. WHEN the user enables timing randomization THEN the system SHALL slightly shift playhead timing left or right for groove
3. WHEN randomization is applied THEN the system SHALL maintain overall pattern integrity
4. IF randomization is disabled THEN the system SHALL play patterns with exact timing and velocity
5. WHEN randomization settings change THEN the system SHALL apply changes to subsequent playback

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a music producer, I want the sequencer interface to match the existing app's visual design, so that the user experience remains consistent.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the sequencer page loads THEN the system SHALL use the existing dark mode color palette
2. WHEN displaying the grid THEN the system SHALL maintain visual clarity and modern design consistency
3. WHEN showing controls THEN the system SHALL match the styling of current pads and components
4. IF the user interacts with sequencer elements THEN the system SHALL provide visual feedback consistent with other app components

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a music producer, I want the sequencer to maintain high performance without audio lag or frame drops, so that I can work efficiently without technical interruptions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the sequencer is running THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent frame rates without drops
2. WHEN audio is playing THEN the system SHALL prevent blocking the main thread
3. WHEN multiple tracks are active THEN the system SHALL handle concurrent audio playback efficiently
4. IF performance issues arise THEN the system SHALL utilize Web Workers or lightweight timing libraries as needed

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a music producer, I want to understand the backend requirements for saving patterns and managing samples, so that I can plan for future persistence features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN planning backend integration THEN the system SHALL define Firebase/Firestore data structure for user patterns
2. WHEN considering sample storage THEN the system SHALL determine if Google Cloud Storage buckets are required
3. WHEN implementing user features THEN the system SHALL establish Firebase Auth rules for sequencer presets
4. IF pattern syncing is needed THEN the system SHALL define strategy for cross-session state management
5. WHEN backend setup is planned THEN the system SHALL document all Firebase and GCP prerequisites

### Requirement 11

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the sequencer developed on a feature branch with isolated testing, so that integration with main is safe and controlled.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN development begins THEN the system SHALL create and use a dedicated feature branch
2. WHEN the sequencer is built THEN the system SHALL function fully in isolation on the feature branch
3. WHEN testing is complete THEN the system SHALL verify performance and design alignment
4. IF all requirements are met THEN the system SHALL prepare for merge into main branch only after approval
