# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Interactive Waveform Visualization system needs to provide real-time, interactive waveform displays for YouTube audio that go beyond static placeholder visualizations. Users should be able to see accurate audio waveforms, interact directly with them to create and edit chops, and experience an intuitive MPC-style editing workflow. The system must handle real-time audio analysis, provide smooth visual feedback, and enable precise sample editing through direct waveform manipulation.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a music producer, I want to see real-time waveform visualization of YouTube audio as it plays, so that I can visually identify musical elements and optimal sampling points.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a YouTube video loads THEN the system SHALL analyze the audio stream and generate a real-time waveform visualization
2. WHEN the audio plays THEN the waveform SHALL display accurate amplitude data that reflects the actual audio content
3. WHEN the waveform is generated THEN it SHALL show frequency content, dynamics, and musical structure with high visual fidelity
4. WHEN audio analysis fails THEN the system SHALL fall back to intelligent procedural waveform generation based on video metadata
5. IF real-time analysis is not possible THEN the system SHALL use progressive waveform generation to build the visualization over time

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a music producer, I want to interact directly with the waveform to create and position chops, so that I can visually select sample regions with precision.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks on the waveform THEN the system SHALL create a new chop at that exact time position, this SHALL work with the already implemented logic of pressing the pads when the user wants to place a timestamp
2. WHEN a user drags on the waveform THEN the system SHALL create a chop with start and end points based on the drag selection
3. WHEN creating chops through waveform interaction THEN the system SHALL provide immediate visual feedback showing the selected region
4. WHEN chops are created THEN they SHALL be visually represented as colored overlays on the waveform
5. WHEN multiple chops exist THEN each SHALL have a distinct visual appearance and be clearly identifiable
6. when the user presses the + or - buttons the waveform SHALL zoom in or out accordingly while preserving all cue points and shifting them accordingly. For example if a user zooms in lots naturally sample points outside of the scope should NOT be vsible. 

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a music producer, I want to drag chop start and end points directly on the waveform, so that I can fine-tune sample boundaries with pixel-perfect precision.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a chop is selected THEN the system SHALL display draggable handles at the start and end points on the waveform
2. WHEN a user drags a chop handle THEN the system SHALL update the chop boundary in real-time with visual feedback
3. WHEN dragging chop boundaries THEN the system SHALL snap to zero-crossings or low-amplitude points for clean cuts
4. WHEN chop boundaries are adjusted THEN the system SHALL display precise timing information during the drag operation
5. WHEN drag operations complete THEN the system SHALL immediately update the chop data and provide audio feedback
6. the user should have a smart < and > button that shifts the sample start slighly in whichever direction they choose they should be able to choose between short/mid/long shift 

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a music producer, I want advanced waveform zoom and navigation controls, so that I can work with precise timing at different levels of detail.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the waveform THEN the system SHALL provide zoom controls that allow magnification from overview to sample-level detail
2. WHEN zoomed in THEN the system SHALL maintain smooth scrolling and panning capabilities across the entire audio timeline
3. WHEN at high zoom levels THEN the waveform SHALL show individual sample points and zero-crossing lines for precise editing
4. WHEN zooming or panning THEN all chop markers and playback indicators SHALL remain accurately positioned
5. WHEN the zoom level changes THEN the waveform rendering SHALL adapt to show appropriate detail for the current magnification

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a music producer, I want the waveform to show real-time playback position and chop relationships, so that I can understand the temporal context of my samples.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN audio is playing THEN the waveform SHALL display a moving playhead that accurately tracks the current playback position
2. WHEN the playhead moves THEN it SHALL provide smooth animation that doesn't interfere with waveform readability
3. WHEN chops are triggered THEN the waveform SHALL highlight the active chop region and show its relationship to the current playback position
4. WHEN multiple chops overlap or are adjacent THEN the waveform SHALL clearly show their boundaries and relationships
5. WHEN the user hovers over chop regions THEN the system SHALL display detailed timing and duration information

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a music producer, I want intelligent waveform generation that works with different audio sources and quality levels, so that I always get useful visual feedback regardless of the source material.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN high-quality audio analysis is available THEN the system SHALL use Web Audio API for accurate frequency and amplitude analysis
2. WHEN direct audio access is limited THEN the system SHALL use alternative analysis methods like visual frame analysis or metadata-based generation
3. WHEN generating procedural waveforms THEN the system SHALL create musically-intelligent patterns that reflect typical song structures
4. WHEN waveform quality is suboptimal THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate the analysis method used and any limitations
5. WHEN switching between different analysis methods THEN the user experience SHALL remain consistent and intuitive

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a music producer, I want the waveform visualization to be performant and responsive, so that it doesn't interfere with my creative workflow or cause system lag.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN rendering waveforms THEN the system SHALL use optimized canvas drawing techniques that maintain 60fps performance
2. WHEN processing large audio files THEN the system SHALL use progressive rendering and Web Workers to prevent UI blocking
3. WHEN multiple waveform operations occur simultaneously THEN the system SHALL prioritize real-time playback and user interactions
4. WHEN system resources are limited THEN the system SHALL gracefully reduce waveform quality while maintaining core functionality
5. WHEN memory usage becomes high THEN the system SHALL implement intelligent caching and cleanup strategies

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a music producer, I want visual enhancements that make the waveform more readable and informative, so that I can quickly identify musical elements and make better sampling decisions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN displaying waveforms THEN the system SHALL use color coding and visual cues to highlight different frequency ranges and dynamics
2. WHEN audio has distinct musical sections THEN the waveform SHALL provide visual hints about song structure like verses, choruses, and breaks
3. WHEN waveform data shows silence or low-amplitude sections THEN these SHALL be clearly distinguished from active audio regions
4. WHEN the user adjusts visual settings THEN the waveform SHALL update in real-time to reflect the new display preferences
5. WHEN accessibility is considered THEN the waveform SHALL provide alternative visual representations for users with different visual needs
