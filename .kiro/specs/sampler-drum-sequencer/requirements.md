# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Sampler Drum Track Sequencer is a performance-optimized sequencer component that integrates YouTube chop timestamps as triggerable sounds within the existing Chopper Page. This feature combines the existing chopper functionality with sequencer-style pattern programming, allowing users to create rhythmic patterns using their YouTube-sourced chops. The sequencer will reuse existing components where efficient and maintain the app's visual consistency while prioritizing performance and simplicity.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a music producer, I want to sequence my YouTube chops in a grid-based pattern sequencer, so that I can create rhythmic compositions using my sampled content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user accesses the Chopper Page THEN the system SHALL display a Sampler Drum Track Sequencer component alongside existing chopper functionality
2. WHEN the user has created chops THEN the sequencer SHALL automatically map up to 64 chops to sequencer tracks (one track per every pad available, map as many tracks as there are samples created)
3. WHEN the user places triggers in the sequencer grid THEN the system SHALL store the pattern & timestamp data for playback
4. WHEN sequencer playback reaches a trigger THEN the system SHALL jump the YouTube video to the corresponding chop timestamp
5. WHEN the user switches between banks THEN the sequencer SHALL update to show the corresponding chops for that bank

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to control sequencer playback with transport controls, so that I can start, stop, and adjust the tempo of my patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user clicks the Start button THEN the sequencer SHALL begin pattern playback at the current tempo
2. WHEN the user clicks the Stop button THEN the sequencer SHALL halt playback and reset to the beginning
3. WHEN the user adjusts the BPM input THEN the sequencer SHALL update playback speed in real-time
4. WHEN the user clicks the Tap Tempo button multiple times THEN the system SHALL calculate and set the BPM based on tap intervals
5. WHEN the user presses the space bar THEN the system SHALL register a tap tempo input
6. WHEN the system calculates tap tempo THEN it SHALL average over at least 4 taps for accuracy

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to interact with a 16-track (x4) sequencer grid, so that I can program rhythmic patterns by placing and removing triggers.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the sequencer displays THEN it SHALL show 16 tracks visible simultaneously
2. WHEN the user clicks on a grid cell THEN the system SHALL toggle a trigger at that position
3. WHEN a track has an assigned chop THEN the system SHALL display the track with the chop's visual styling
4. WHEN a track has no assigned chop THEN the system SHALL display an empty track that can still receive triggers
5. WHEN the user places a trigger on an empty track THEN the system SHALL store the trigger but not produce audio during playback
6. WHEN playback reaches a trigger on an assigned track THEN the system SHALL jump to the corresponding YouTube timestamp

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to navigate between different banks of chops, so that I can access all 64 supported chops across multiple sequencer views.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the sequencer displays THEN it SHALL show navigation controls for switching banks
2. WHEN the user clicks a bank navigation button THEN the sequencer SHALL switch to display the corresponding 16 chops
3. WHEN the system supports 64 chops total THEN it SHALL organize them into 4 banks of 16 chops each
4. WHEN initially implementing THEN the system SHALL support 2 banks (32 chops) with expansion capability
5. WHEN switching banks THEN the system SHALL preserve pattern data for all banks
6. WHEN a bank contains no chops THEN the system SHALL display empty tracks that can still be programmed

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the sequencer to maintain high performance, so that I can work with complex patterns without experiencing lag or timing issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the sequencer renders THEN it SHALL minimize visual effects and animations on the pad grid
2. WHEN the sequencer processes audio triggers THEN it SHALL maintain precise timing without drift
3. WHEN the user interacts with the grid THEN the system SHALL respond immediately without noticeable delay
4. WHEN the sequencer reuses existing components THEN it SHALL only use efficient and optimal implementations
5. WHEN the sequencer operates THEN it SHALL not cause performance degradation to existing chopper functionality
6. WHEN the system handles pattern data THEN it SHALL use efficient data structures and avoid unnecessary re-renders

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want the sequencer interface to be consistent with the existing app design, so that I have a cohesive user experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the sequencer displays THEN it SHALL use the same visual styling as existing Chopper and Sequencer pages
2. WHEN the sequencer shows track information THEN it SHALL use consistent color schemes and typography
3. WHEN the user interacts with controls THEN they SHALL behave similarly to existing transport controls
4. WHEN the sequencer integrates with the Chopper Page THEN it SHALL maintain the existing layout structure
5. WHEN the system displays the sequencer THEN it SHALL use the same backdrop blur and border styling as other components

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want seamless integration between chop creation and sequencer programming, so that I can efficiently build patterns with my samples.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user creates a new chop THEN the sequencer SHALL automatically assign it to the next available track
2. WHEN the user deletes a chop THEN the sequencer SHALL update to reflect the removed assignment
3. WHEN the user modifies chop timestamps THEN the sequencer SHALL continue to trigger the updated timestamps
4. WHEN the sequencer triggers a chop THEN it SHALL use the existing YouTube player integration
5. WHEN the user switches between chopper and sequencer modes THEN the system SHALL maintain all chop assignments and pattern data

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a user, I want tap tempo functionality with minimal UI footprint, so that I can quickly set tempo without cluttering the interface.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the tap tempo button displays THEN it SHALL occupy minimal screen space
2. WHEN the user taps the button THEN the system SHALL provide immediate visual feedback
3. WHEN the user taps via space bar THEN the system SHALL register the input equivalently to button clicks
4. WHEN calculating tempo THEN the system SHALL require a minimum of 4 taps before setting BPM
5. WHEN the user stops tapping THEN the system SHALL reset the tap counter after a timeout period
6. WHEN displaying calculated BPM THEN the system SHALL round to the nearest whole number for usability
