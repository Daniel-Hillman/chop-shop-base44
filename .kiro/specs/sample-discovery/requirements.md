# Sample Discovery Feature Requirements

## Introduction

The Sample Discovery Feature is a standalone page that allows users to discover vintage samples from around the world (1950s-1990s music) and load them directly into The Chop Shop's existing YouTube player. This feature must be completely isolated from the core ChopperPage functionality to ensure zero performance impact and maintain the pristine operation of the existing audio sampling workflow.

The feature addresses the critical need for sample discovery while learning from previous implementation issues including page refresh problems, performance degradation, service failures, and state management complexity.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Isolated Sample Discovery Page

**User Story:** As a music producer, I want a dedicated sample discovery page that is completely separate from the chopper functionality, so that I can discover new samples without affecting my core workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user navigates to /sample-discovery THEN the system SHALL display a dedicated discovery page with its own YouTube player
2. WHEN the discovery page is loaded THEN the system SHALL NOT import or affect any ChopperPage components or state
3. WHEN users interact with discovery features THEN the system SHALL NOT cause any performance impact on ChopperPage
4. WHEN discovery services fail THEN the system SHALL NOT affect the core chopper functionality in any way

### Requirement 2: Vintage Sample Discovery

**User Story:** As a music producer, I want to discover vintage samples from the 1950s-1990s across various genres, so that I can find authentic sounds for my productions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the discovery page THEN the system SHALL display samples from 1950-1995 time period
2. WHEN a user applies genre filters THEN the system SHALL show samples filtered by Soul, Jazz, Funk, Blues, Afrobeat, and other vintage genres
3. WHEN a user applies year range filters THEN the system SHALL show samples within the specified year range
4. WHEN no samples are found for filters THEN the system SHALL display mock/fallback samples with clear messaging
5. WHEN the YouTube API is unavailable THEN the system SHALL gracefully degrade to mock sample data

### Requirement 3: Shuffle and Randomization

**User Story:** As a music producer, I want to shuffle and randomize sample discovery, so that I can serendipitously find new sounds without manual searching.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks the shuffle button THEN the system SHALL display a new random set of samples without page refresh
2. WHEN shuffle is activated THEN all buttons SHALL have type="button" to prevent form submission
3. WHEN randomization occurs THEN the system SHALL respect current filter settings (genre, year range)
4. WHEN shuffle fails THEN the system SHALL show fallback samples and clear error messaging

### Requirement 4: Sample Playback Integration

**User Story:** As a music producer, I want to load discovered samples directly into a YouTube player, so that I can preview and evaluate samples before using them in my chopper workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user selects a discovered sample THEN the system SHALL load it in the discovery page's dedicated YouTube player
2. WHEN a sample is loaded THEN the system SHALL display sample metadata (title, artist, year, genre, duration)
3. WHEN playback fails THEN the system SHALL show clear error messages and retry options
4. WHEN a user wants to use a sample in chopper THEN the system SHALL provide a clear path to transfer the YouTube URL

### Requirement 5: Favorites and History Management

**User Story:** As a music producer, I want to save favorite samples and track my discovery history, so that I can easily return to samples I've found interesting.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user marks a sample as favorite THEN the system SHALL persist the favorite in local storage
2. WHEN a user views a sample THEN the system SHALL add it to their discovery history
3. WHEN a user accesses favorites THEN the system SHALL display all saved favorite samples
4. WHEN a user accesses history THEN the system SHALL display recently viewed samples in chronological order
5. WHEN storage operations fail THEN the system SHALL continue functioning with in-memory state

### Requirement 6: Advanced Filtering Options

**User Story:** As a music producer, I want advanced filtering options including tempo, duration, and instruments, so that I can find samples that match my specific production needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user applies tempo filters THEN the system SHALL show samples within specified BPM ranges
2. WHEN a user applies duration filters THEN the system SHALL show samples within specified time ranges
3. WHEN a user applies instrument filters THEN the system SHALL show samples featuring specified instruments
4. WHEN multiple filters are applied THEN the system SHALL show samples matching ALL filter criteria
5. WHEN advanced filters are unavailable THEN the system SHALL gracefully disable those options

### Requirement 7: Error Handling and Recovery

**User Story:** As a music producer, I want the discovery feature to handle errors gracefully, so that service failures don't interrupt my workflow or crash the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN YouTube API calls fail THEN the system SHALL automatically retry with exponential backoff
2. WHEN all API attempts fail THEN the system SHALL display mock samples with clear "demo mode" messaging
3. WHEN network errors occur THEN the system SHALL show user-friendly error messages without technical details
4. WHEN discovery errors occur THEN the system SHALL NOT affect other parts of the application
5. WHEN services are unavailable THEN the system SHALL provide fallback content and recovery suggestions

### Requirement 8: Performance and Optimization

**User Story:** As a music producer, I want the discovery feature to be performant and responsive, so that I can efficiently browse through samples without delays.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the discovery page loads THEN the system SHALL display initial content within 2 seconds
2. WHEN users apply filters THEN the system SHALL show results within 1 second for cached data
3. WHEN API calls are made THEN the system SHALL implement proper caching to avoid excessive requests
4. WHEN memory usage grows THEN the system SHALL implement cleanup to prevent memory leaks
5. WHEN performance degrades THEN the system SHALL log metrics for debugging and optimization

### Requirement 9: User Interface and Experience

**User Story:** As a music producer, I want an intuitive and responsive discovery interface that matches the existing application design, so that the feature feels integrated while remaining functionally separate.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users access the discovery page THEN the system SHALL display a design consistent with ChopperPage aesthetics
2. WHEN users interact on mobile devices THEN the system SHALL provide a fully responsive layout
3. WHEN API calls are in progress THEN the system SHALL show clear loading states and progress indicators
4. WHEN users navigate the interface THEN the system SHALL provide smooth animations without affecting performance
5. WHEN users with accessibility needs access the feature THEN the system SHALL provide proper ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, and screen reader support

### Requirement 10: Development and Testing Strategy

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a robust development and testing approach for the discovery feature, so that I can ensure reliability and maintainability while preventing regressions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN developing the feature THEN the system SHALL start with mock data to ensure UI works before API integration
2. WHEN integrating real APIs THEN the system SHALL add functionality incrementally with proper testing
3. WHEN testing the feature THEN the system SHALL verify zero impact on ChopperPage performance and functionality
4. WHEN error scenarios occur THEN the system SHALL handle all failure modes gracefully
5. WHEN the feature is complete THEN the system SHALL pass comprehensive user acceptance testing
